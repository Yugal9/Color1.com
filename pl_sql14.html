    <h1>Database Triggers </h1>
    <p>Trigger is invoked by Oracle engine automatically whenever a specified event occurs.Trigger is stored into database and invoked repeatedly, when specific condition match. <br>

        Triggers are stored programs, which are automatically executed or fired when some event occurs. <br>
        
        Triggers are written to be executed in response to any of the following events. <br>
        
        A database manipulation (DML) statement (DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE). <br>
        A database definition (DDL) statement (CREATE, ALTER, or DROP). <br>
        A database operation (SERVERERROR, LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP, or SHUTDOWN). <br>
        Triggers could be defined on the table, view, schema, or database with which the event is associated.</p>

           <p> Here,

            CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name: It creates or replaces an existing trigger with the trigger_name.
            {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} : This specifies when the trigger would be executed. The INSTEAD OF clause is used for creating trigger on a view.
            {INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE}: This specifies the DML operation.
            [OF col_name]: This specifies the column name that would be updated.
            [ON table_name]: This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.
            [REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n]: This allows you to refer new and old values for various DML statements, like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
            [FOR EACH ROW]: This specifies a row level trigger, i.e., the trigger would be executed for each row being affected. Otherwise the trigger will execute just once when the SQL statement is executed, which is called a table level trigger.
            WHEN (condition): This provides a condition for rows for which the trigger would fire. This clause is valid only for row level triggers.
        </p>
        <h2>Example: INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger that prevents deletion of rows from a table</h2>
