    <h1>Variables & Constants</h1>
    <p>PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic.  <br>
        You can declare constants and variables in the declarative part of any PL/SQL block, subprogram, or package. Declarations allocate storage for a value, specify its datatype, and specify a name that you can reference. Declarations can also assign an initial value and impose the NOT NULL constraint.
        <br><br>
        A variable is a reserved memory area for storing the data of a particular datatype. It is an identifier which is identifies memory locations where data is stored. This memory is reserved at the time of declaration of a variable which is done in the DECLARE section of any PL/SQL block. <br><br> </p>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p class="p1">Variable_name  datatype(size);</p>
       <h2> Rules for declaring a Variable in PL/SQL</h2>
 <p> Following are some important rules to keep in mind while defining and using a variable in PL/SQL: <br><br>

A variable name is user-defined. It should begin with a character and can be followed by maximum of 29 characters.
Keywords (i.e, reserved words ) of PL/SQL cannot be used as variable name. <br>
Multiple variables can be declared in a single line provided they must be separated from each other by at least one space and comma.<br>
For eg: a,b,c int;<br><br>

Variable names containing two words should not contain space between them. It must be covered by underscore instead.
For eg: Roll_no<br>

A variable name is case sensitive, which means a_var is not same as A_var<br>
</p>
 <h2>PL/SQL Constants</h2> <p>
Constants are those values which when declared remain fixed throughout the PL/SQL block. For declaring constants, a constant keyword is used. <br>
<br>

Syntax for declaring constants: <br>

Constant_Name  constant  Datatype(size) := value; <br></p>
