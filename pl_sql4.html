    <h1>Pl/SQL Architecture</h1>
    <p>The PL/SQL runtime system is a technology and not an independent product. This technology is actually like an engine that exhibits PL/SQL blocks, subprograms like functions and procedures. This engine can be installed in an Oracle Server or in application development tools such as Oracle Form Builder, Oracle Reports Builder etc. <br><br>

        PL/SQL can reside in two environments â€“ <br><br>

1. The Oracle Server <br>
2. The Oracle tools <br><br>
These two environments are independent of each other. In either environment, the PL/SQL engine accepts any valid PL/SQL block as input. The PL/SQL engine executes the procedural part of the statements and sends the SQL statement executer in the Oracle Server. A single transfer is required to send the block from the application to the Oracle Server, thus improving performance, especially in a Client-Server network. PL/SQL code can also be stored in the Oracle server as subprograms that can be referenced by any number of applications connected to the database.
